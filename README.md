## Disclaimers

-   I have no afiliation with StataCorp; this software is provided in good faith without knowingly including any intellectual property of StataCorp.
-   This software is not complete, simply a rough attempt to convert the SMCL that I currently have into something readable on the command line.


## Usage

```bash
smcl2log in.smcl > out.log
smcl2log in.smcl out.log
```

The [SMCL manual](http://www.stata.com/manuals13/psmcl.pdf) contains a description of the file format, syntax and commands.
